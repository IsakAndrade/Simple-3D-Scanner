# Simple-3D-Scanner
The main goal of this project is to create a simple 3D scanner using the Sharp Infrared Proximity Sensor and an arduino. This system consist of a selection menu using an Oled display communicating with the Arduino Uno using the I2C bus

## Components needed
To build this system you will need:
*1x Arduino Uno
*1x Button
*1x Resistor
*1x Potentiometer
*1x Oled screen
*2x DC-motors
*2xH-Bridges
